#TODO
    - CustomSupabaseSessionHandler not working.
        - how to test: 
            - Logout
            - Login
            - Access Crud table private RLS page
            - Insert some row
            - you will see the row displayed below
            - press F5 on the browser
            - the rows will disapear
        - Maybe i created CustomSupabaseSessionHandler wrong. But it seem like that the token is not being sent with the headers...

    - create policy to insert that check if the user_id is the same of the user logged in trying to insert.

    -----> This is because of old files in cache in the browser. Clear cache by clicking in the clear button (just ctrl + f5 doesn't work) and after press ctrl + f5. This will solve.



# JWT ERROR
    - WHEN CLICK IN LOGOUT BUTTON OR TRY TO GET DATA FROM DATABASE, BUT THE JWT IS ALREADY EXPIRED:
        - this problem only happens when login, close the app, later, after token expired, the app is open again.
        - I set the JWT expiry limit to 180 just to test this.
