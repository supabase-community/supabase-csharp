#   PKG_DIR/PKG_NAME/PKG_PROJ/PKG_TEST[]  the package(s) — one entry, or many
#   BUILD_TARGET   what `dotnet build` compiles: a package's test project
#                  (fast, single scope) or the .sln (solution scope)
#   SCAN_TARGET    what security + api-declared inspect: the production project or
#                  the .sln
#   SCOPE_DIR      the git / PublicAPI / stack root (package dir, or repo root)
#
# Per-package stages (build attribution, tests, e2e) loop over the arrays; the
# genuinely scope-wide stages (security, api-declared, api-diff) run once.
